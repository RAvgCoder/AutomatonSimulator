# automaton_core

Automaton Simulator is a tool for simulating and visualizing finite automata. It allows you to define and interact with deterministic finite automata (DFA) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), providing functionalities to input automata, perform simulations, and visualize the behavior.

## Features

- **DFA and NFA Support:** Define and simulate both deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata.
- **Input Definition:** Define states, transitions, and accept states using a user-friendly interface.
- **Simulation:** Simulate the behavior of defined automata on input strings.
- **Visualization:** Visualize automaton transitions and simulations for better understanding.
